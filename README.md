<h1>Welcome to Four Corners 🗺️</h1>

<strong>Four Corners</strong>is a simple exercise in getting comfortable with the fundamentals of React Native. A client-side-only app (for now), it fetches from the faithful RESTful Countries API.
Browse through a list of countries, show your interest in them, and navigate an app designed to make learning about your next destination as easy as daydreaming about it.
